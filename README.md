A WIP URL minifier API (Front End Coming Soon).

Made for fun and practice.

Uses Node, Express and MongoDB.

You can set up a free database here: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas

Set up a cluster in the cload and replace the credentials in the file config/default.json - "mongoURI":</YourCredentials>

Use {"longUrl":</YourLongUrl>} in Postman or another client to test.
